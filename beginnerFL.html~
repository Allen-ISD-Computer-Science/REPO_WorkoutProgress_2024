Repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.</h5>

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 2: Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 3: Adjust the barbell to just below shoulder height while standing then load the desired weight onto the bar.
Place an adjustable bench beneath the bar in an upright position.
Sit down on the bench and unrack the bar using a pronated grip.
Inhale, brace, tuck the chin, then lower the bar to the top of your chest.
Exhale and press the bar back to lockout.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 4: Using a pronated grip, grasp the pull bar with a wider than shoulder width grip.
Take a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats.
Pull your chin towards the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.</h5>

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 5: Select your desired weight and sit on the edge of a flat bench.
To get into position, lay back and keep the bar close to your chest. Once you are supine, press the weight to lockout.
Lower the weights towards your head by unlocking the elbows and allowing the ez bar to drop toward your forehead or just above.
Once your forearms reach parallel or just below, reverse the movement by extending the elbows while flexing the triceps to lockout the weight.
Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 6: The standing dumbbell curl is a good way to correct any strength and size imbalances in the biceps as it works each muscle individually. Set up for the exercise by grasping a set of dumbbells and standing straight up with the dumbbells by your side.
Your palms should be facing up, and the dumbbells not touching your body.
Before starting the set, take up the slack by lifting up the weight slightly so the tension is on your bicep muscles.
Starting with your weakest arm (usually the left), curl the dumbbell up as far as possible.
Squeeze the bicep at the top of the exercise, and then slowly lower the weight down without it touching your body or taking the tension off your bicep.
Repeat for the other arm.
That's one rep. Now repeat for the desired amount of reps to complete the set.</h5>
