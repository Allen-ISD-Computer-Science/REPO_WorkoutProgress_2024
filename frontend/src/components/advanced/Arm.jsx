			    <td>The standing barbell curl is the cornerstone of many bicep building routines. Grasp a barbell or Olympic bar at around shoulder width apart using an underhand grip (palms facing up).
Stand straight up, feet together (you may be more comfortable putting one foot back for stability), back straight, and with your arms fully extended.
The bar should not be touching your body.
Keeping your eyes facing forwards, elbows tucked in at your sides, and your body completely still, slowly curl the bar up.
Squeeze your biceps hard at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower it back to the starting position.
Repeat for desired reps.</td>

Sit on the preacher bench and grip the EZ bar with your hands shoulder-width apart using an underhand (palms facing up) grip. (note: You can use a wide or narrow grip on this exercise)
Keeping your back straight and eyes facing forward, take the weight off the rack to support it with your arms slightly bent. This is the starting position.
Slowly bring the weight up until your forearms are at a right angle to the floor.

			    <td>Lie flat on a bench and set your hands at shoulder width.
Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
