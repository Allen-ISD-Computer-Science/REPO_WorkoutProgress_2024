			    <td>Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.
To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.
Slightly retract your shoulder blades, unlock your elbows, and slowly lower the dumbbells laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.
Once the dumbbells reach chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pecs together and bringing the dumbbells back to their starting position.
Without allowing the dumbbells to touch, start the next repetition, and continue until the set is completed.</td>

The dumbbells should not be touching and you should be using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Bending at the elbows only, keeping your elbows fixed and pointing at your hips, slowly lower the dumbbells down beside your head until they are about level with your ears. Pause and squeeze the triceps. Then raise the dumbbells back to the starting position. Do not lock the elbows out, and then repeat for desired reps.</td>

			    <td>Grab the parallel dip bars with an inward grip.
If the bars are adjustable, adjust them to around shoulder-width apart.
Jump up off the floor and take your weight on the bars.
The key to hitting your triceps on this version of the dip is to keep your body as straight as possible and dont lean forward. This may mean not crossing your legs and keeping them hanging down.
Slowly lower yourself down, keeping your eyes facing forward.
Lower until your elbow is at around the same height as your shoulder, and then raise your body back up without locking your arms at the top of the movement.
Repeat for desired reps.</td>
