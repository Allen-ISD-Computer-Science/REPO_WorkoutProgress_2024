			    <td>Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesnt, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Dont lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.</td>

Take a deep breath and extend your legs as you flex your quadriceps.
As you lock out the knees, exhale to complete the repetition.
Slowly lower your feet back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</td>

			    <td>The lying leg curl is a great exercise to isolate the hamstrings. Set up for the leg curl by selecting the weight you want to use on the stack and adjusting the padding to suit your leg length. Lay face down on the machine. The padding should be positioned just above the back of your ankles. If its higher than that, adjust the length. Tense up the hamstrings by taking the weight slightly off the stack. This is the starting position for the exercise. Squeeze the hamstrings and curl the weight up as far as possible. Squeeze the hamstring hard, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.</td>
