	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 2: Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

	 <h5>Instructions Exercise 6: The standing dumbbell curl is a good way to correct any strength and size imbalances in the biceps as it works each muscle individually. Set up for the exercise by grasping a set of dumbbells and standing straight up with the dumbbells by your side.
Your palms should be facing up, and the dumbbells not touching your body.
Before starting the set, take up the slack by lifting up the weight slightly so the tension is on your bicep muscles.
Starting with your weakest arm (usually the left), curl the dumbbell up as far as possible.
Squeeze the bicep at the top of the exercise, and then slowly lower the weight down without it touching your body or taking the tension off your bicep.
Repeat for the other arm.
	   That's one rep. Now repeat for the desired amount of reps to complete the set.</h5>

Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.
Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.
Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.
You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.
Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.
Take a small step back and stabilize yourself.
Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.
Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels.
Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.</h5>
