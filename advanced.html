	<br>
	<h5>Instructions: Shoulder Exercise 3:
	  The barbell upright row is one of the best exercises for building the upper traps and shoulders. Load up a barbell with the weight you want to use and stand facing it with your feet at around shoulder width apart. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down), and hands slightly closer than shoulder width apart. Pick the bar up, bending at the knees and keeping your back straight. Keeping your back straight and eyes facing forwards, lift the bar straight up while keeping it as close to your body as possible (you should pull the bar up to around chest height - nearly touching your chin). Pause, and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps. <h5>

	    <br>
	    <h5>Instructions: Shoulder Exercise 4:
	      The dumbbell lateral raise is a good exercise for building width in your upper body which gives you the "V" shape. Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides. Your palms should be facing your body. You should be holding the dumbbells slightly off your body, as this keeps the tension on the side delts. This is your starting position for the exercise. To execute, slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts. Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Do not let the dumbbells touch your body, and then raise them for the next rep. </h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Shoulder Exercise 5:
	      Secure a flat bench and select the desired weight from the rack. Sit in an upright position and then hinge forward from the hips. Allow the arms to hang straight down from the shoulders with a neutral grip and dumbbells behind your calves. Take a deep breath and pull the dumbbells towards the ceiling using the rear deltoids. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. </h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Arm Exercise 1:
	      The standing barbell curl is the cornerstone of many bicep building routines. Grasp a barbell or Olympic bar at around shoulder width apart using an underhand grip (palms facing up). Stand straight up, feet together (you may be more comfortable putting one foot back for stability), back straight, and with your arms fully extended. The bar should not be touching your body. Keeping your eyes facing forwards, elbows tucked in at your sides, and your body completely still, slowly curl the bar up. Squeeze your biceps hard at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower it back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.</h5>

	    <br>
	    <h5>Instructions: Arm Exercise 2:
	      The barbell preacher curl is a great exercise to isolate the biceps. Adjust the seat on the preacher bench so that your upper arms sit comfortably on the padding when seated. Load the desired weight on the barbell. Sit on the preacher bench and grip the barbell with your hands shoulder width apart using an underhand (palms facing up) grip. Keeping your back straight and eyes facing forwards, take the weight off the rack so you're supporting it with your arms slightly bent. This is the starting position. Slowly raise the weight until your forearms are at a right angle to the floor. Squeeze the bicep at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower it back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Arm Exercise 3: 
	      Set up for the cable curl by attaching a straight bar to the low pulley cable and selecting the weight you want to use on the stack. Stand facing the cable machine with your legs shoulder width apart. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up), and your hands about shoulder width apart. Keeping your elbows tucked in by your sides, slowly curl the bar up as far as possible. Squeeze the biceps at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower it back to starting position. Do not pause, but go straight into the next rep!</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Arm Exercise 4: Lie flat on a bench and set your hands at shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Arm Exercise 5: 
	      Grab the parallel dip bars with an inward grip. If the bars are adjustable, adjust them to around shoulder-width apart. Jump up off the floor and take your weight on the bars. The key to hitting your triceps on this version of the dip is to keep your body as straight as possible and don't lean forward. This may mean not crossing your legs and keeping them hanging down. Slowly lower yourself down, keeping your eyes facing forward. Lower until your elbow is at around the same height as your shoulder, and then raise your body back up without locking your arms at the top of the movement. Repeat for desired reps.</h5>

	      Sit on the end of a flat bench with a barbell on your thighs. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down) with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Bring the bar up to your chest and lay down on your back. Extend your arms straight up above your chest. Keeping your elbows fixed in place and not pointing out, slowly lower the bar until it is about an inch from your forehead (hence the name skullcrusher!). Pause, and then slowly extend your arms back to the starting position. Do not lock your elbows out, and then repeat for desired reps.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Abs Exercise 1: 
The hanging leg raise is an awesome exercise for building the lower abs. All you need for this exercise is somewhere to hang from. It could be a chinup bar or it could be a tree. Once you're hanging, tense up the mid section. While keeping your legs straight, raise them up slowly. You should raise your legs are high as possible. Pause for a second, and slowly lower your legs back to the starting position. Repeat for desired reps.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Leg Exercise 1: 
	      Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use. Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar. Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack. Take a small step back and stabilize yourself. Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels. Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Chest Exercise 1:
	      Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>

	    <h5>Instructions: Chest Exercise 3: 
	      Step up on the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip.     Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor.     Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms.     Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

	    <h5>Instructions: Chest Exercisse 4:
	      Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.     To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.     Slightly retract your shoulder blades, unlock your elbows, and slowly lower the dumbbells laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.     Once the dumbbells reach chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pecs together and bringing the dumbbells back to their starting position.     Without allowing the dumbbells to touch, start the next repetition, and continue until the set is completed.

	    <h5>Instructions: Abs Exercise 1:
	      The exercise ball crunch is a great all round ab exercise. Lower back support makes it ideal for those with lower back problems/injuries. Sit on the exercise ball with your feet flat on the floor wider than shoulder with apart. Step forward with your feet allowing the exercise ball to roll back to your lower back. Touch the side of your head with the tips of your fingers. This is the start position. Crunching your abs, pull your torso up so your elbows are aiming for your knees. Squeeze the abs tight and pause.  Then lower back to the start position. Repeat for desired reps.
