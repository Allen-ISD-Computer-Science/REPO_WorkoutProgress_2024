<h5>Triceps Exercise 1: Sets 3: Reps 8-10</h5>
<h5>Triceps Exercise 2: Sets 3: Reps 10</h5>
<h5>Triceps Exercise 3: Sets 3: Reps 10</h5>
<br>
<h5>Instructions Exercise 1: Sit on the end of a flat bench with a barbell on your thighs. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down) with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Bring the bar up to your chest and lay down on your back. Extend your arms straight up above your chest. Keeping your elbows fixed in place and not pointing out, slowly lower the bar until it is about an inch from your forehead (hence the name skullcrusher!).Pause, and then slowly extend your arms back to the starting position. Do not lock your elbows out, and then repeat for desired reps.</h5>
<h5>Instructions Exercise 2:Get into the starting position for the standing one-arm dumbbell extension by grasping a dumbbell in your left hand and holding it above your head with your palm facing forward. Your elbow should be slightly bent. You can use your right arm to stabilize your body. Begin the movement by bending at the elbow only and slowly lowering the dumbbell behind your neck. Once the dumbbell is down as far as possible, slowly raise it back to the starting position. Do not lock your elbow out at the top of the movement, and then repeat for desired reps.</h5>
<h5>Instructions Exercise 3: Attach a straight bar to a cable stack as high as possible and assume a standing position. Grasp the straight bar with a pronated grip (palms facing down) and lean forward slightly by hinging at the hips. Initiate the movement by extending the elbows and flexing the triceps.Pull the handle downward until the elbows are almost locked out and then slowly lower under control back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>
<br>
<h5>Shoulders Exercise 1: Sets 4: Reps 12</h5>
<h5>Shoulders Exercise 2: Sets 4: 15, 12, 8, 8 (adding weight)</h5>
<br>
<h5>Instructions Exercise 1: Select the desired weight and load it onto a barbell. Assume a shoulder width stance and grasp the bar at shoulder width with a pronated grip.Inhale, brace your abs, and raise the arms vertically while keeping the elbows nearly locked out. Once the arms are parallel with the floor, slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</h5>
<h5>Instructions Exercise 2: The dumbbell lateral raise is a good exercise for building width in your upper body which gives you the "V" shape. Grab a set of dumbbells and stand straight up with the dumbbells at your sides.Your palms should be facing your body. You should be holding the dumbbells slightly off your body, as this keeps the tension on the side delts. This is your starting position for the exercise. To execute, slowly raise the dumbbells up to around shoulder height. It's important that you do not let your wrists go above your elbows while raising the weight, as this will take the work off the side delts and put it on the front delts. Pause at the top of the movement, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.Do not let the dumbbells touch your body, and then raise them for the next rep.</h5>
